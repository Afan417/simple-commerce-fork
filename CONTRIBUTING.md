# Setup Guide for contributors

If you're going to make contributions to Simple Commerce with writing code, fixing bugs etc, you'll want a separate install for that.

First, create a Statamic site which you'll use for Simple Commerce development.

```
composer create-project statamic/statamic simple-commerce-dev --prefer-dist --stability=dev
```

Then pull down the Simple Commerce repository (or your fork of it) to your project's folder.

```
git clone git@github.com:doublethreedigital/simple-commerce.git sp-source
```

You should have the Simple Commerce stuff in your `sp-source` folder. To install it in your Statamic site, open up it's `composer.json` file and add a few things.

The first thing to add is the `require` package thing:

```json
"require": {
	"doublethreedigital/simple-commerce": "dev-master"
},
```

And also add this repositories section, it'll tell Composer that we should load the package from our computer instead of downloading it from Packagist.

```json
"repositories": [
        {
            "type": "path",
            "url": "sp-source"
        }
]
```

And then just run `composer install` and Simple Commerce should be installed and you can work on your first pull request! ü•≥
