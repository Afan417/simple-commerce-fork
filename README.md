While the code is open-source, it's important to remember that once Simple Commerce has been released you'll need to buy a license for each site using Simple Commerce. Licenses will cost **$199** *(probably)*. If you want to purchase a license before then or want to show your support, [get in touch](https://doublethree.digital/contact).
