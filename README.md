Simple Commerce is a perfectly simple e-commerce solution for Statamic 3. 

This repository contains the code for Simple Commerce. While the code is open-source, it's important to remember that once Simple Commerce has been released, you'll need to purchase a license for each site where you want to use it in production. If you wish to buy one before release, [get in touch with Duncan](mailto:duncan@doublethree.digital).

## Documentation
