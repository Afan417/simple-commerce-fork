# Simple Commerce
Simple Commerce is a simple e-commerce addon for Statamic 3. It's been built from the ground up to feel as native to Statamic as possible, with entries for all products and orders, freedom of your site's front-end stack and full control over the blueprints that define your product data. It also includes a number of other features:

* [Product Variants](https://sc-docs.doublethree.digital/v2.1/product-variants)
* [Built-in support for popular gateways](https://sc-docs.doublethree.digital/v2.1/gateways), like Stripe and Mollie.
* [Supports Digital Products](https://github.com/doublethreedigital/sc-digital-products)
* Shipping methods, different shipping prices for different addresses
* Ready for extension, with events, hooks and APIs.
