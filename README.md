## About Simple Commerce

Simple Commerce is a perfectly simple e-commerce solution for Statamic. It's simple for both developers and end-users.

This repository contains the code for Simple Commerce but it's important to understand that using this software in production requires a license which you can get from the Statamic Marketplace.

> **Warning:** It's probably best you learn how [Statamic](https://statamic.com) works before learning how Simple Commerce works.

### Features

Stripe payments, events, notifications for staff and customers, control panel widgets, front-end boilerplate, tax, shipping and discounting.

## Testing Group

**Welcome tester!** You're one of the first people to ever look over this codebase. Until now it's pretty much only been me (Duncan). This means there will be stuff that's broken, that's just a fact. 

If you do find anything that's broken, please let me know by reporting a bug. It'll be really helpful in making sure its the best e-commerce solution for everyone. ðŸ˜ƒ

### Technically...

Technically you shouldn't be using Simple Commerce in production until its released but there's not anything from stopping you. Just bear in mind that if you do run this in production, you'll need to purchase a license once it has been released on the Marketplace.

Also, we can't make any promises that things will stay the same. You won't believe how many times things have been refactored, rebuilt or removed. So you may find stuff breaking out of nowhere... (read the commit logs to find out what happened ðŸ˜‚)

## Using Simple Commerce

We want to make Simple Commerce as *simple* as can be for a developer to throw up a quick e-commerce site for a client. Right now we've got some [rough documentation](./docs/readme.md) on how things work for you to check out.
