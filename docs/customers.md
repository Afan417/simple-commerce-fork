# Customers

Customers are people who have purchased products in your Commerce store.

When someone goes through the checkout flow, it will check if a customer already exists with the same email, if yes, an existing customer is used and if no, a new customer is created.

> Currently, customers can't be assosiated with Statamic users, however we could add this feature later.
