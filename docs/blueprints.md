Simple Commerce provides its own blueprints for each of the publish forms. For example, we have blueprints for products, orders, customers and product categories.

During installation, the blueprints will be copied over from `vendor/damcclean/commerce/resources/blueprints` to your site's `resources/blueprints` directory. Because the blueprints are copied over, you can actually edit them to fit the site you're building. However, because Simple Commerce uses a database to store data, we can't just make columns up on the fly like you can when using flat files. // TODO: add a config to add custom attributes here
