# Migrating

For existing e-commerce stores, moving to a new platform can be a bit of a pain. You have to migrate all your products, orders, coupons, customers etc, and if you do it wrong, well... it's never a good ending.

After launch, we're planning on building migration tools to help you migrate as much as you can from other systems to Simple Commerce. If you've got any thoughts or suggestions of what we should write a migrator for, [let us know](mailto:addons@doublethree.digital).
