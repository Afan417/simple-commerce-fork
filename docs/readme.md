# Simple Commerce Docs

Welcome to the Simple Commerce Documentation! We've written some documentation on everything from installing to setting up user permissions to building your store's frontend with our neat set of helpers.

## Database vs flat-file

Unlike Statamic itself using flat-files, **Simple Commerce uses a MySQL database**. There are a variety of advantages a *real* database gives us. Things like relationships, security, speed. We initially tried to make Commerce work just on files but it ended up being near enough impossible, especially if we want it to scale to more than just a few products.
